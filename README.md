# ChangeTabLabelComponent
A Lightning Component for Salesforce that will update the workspace tab label - this works for all objects by using a field for that object. 

For Cases, Chats, Messaging Sessions and Work Orders you can also choose to use the associated Contact or Account Name instead by selecting the relevant checkbox

You can add further support for the Contact or Account to other objects by adding the lookup to contact/account in the ChangeTabLabelController Apex class.
